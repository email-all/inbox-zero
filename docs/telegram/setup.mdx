# Telegram Integration Setup

This guide is for self-hosted deployments that want to enable Telegram chat with the Inbox Zero assistant.

## What Telegram currently supports

- AI assistant chat in **direct messages** with the Inbox Zero bot
- Account linking with one-time `/connect <code>` commands

Currently not supported on Telegram:

- Channel/group-based meeting brief delivery
- Channel/group-based attachment filing notifications

Those channel notification features are Slack-only today.

## 1. Create a Telegram bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and start a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a display name and bot username (must end with `bot`)
4. Copy the bot token BotFather returns — this is your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

## 2. Configure the webhook

Set your bot's webhook to Inbox Zero:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://<your-domain>/api/telegram/events" \
  -d "secret_token=<TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET_TOKEN>"
```

If you do not want to use a secret token, omit `secret_token` from the command.

You can verify webhook status with:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
```

## 3. Set environment variables

Set these in `apps/web/.env` (or your deployment env):

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET_TOKEN= # optional but recommended
```

If `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is missing, the Telegram connect option is hidden in the UI and `/api/telegram/events` returns `503`.

If `TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET_TOKEN` is set, webhooks must include `x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token` with the same value or requests are rejected.

## 4. Connect a user account from Inbox Zero

Each Inbox Zero email account links to a Telegram user via a connect code:

1. In Inbox Zero, go to **Settings** → **Connected Apps**
2. Click **Connect Telegram**
3. Copy the generated command: `/connect <code>`
4. Open a direct message with your bot in Telegram
5. Send the command

After linking, the user can chat with the assistant in that DM.

## 5. Validate end-to-end

Quick checks:

1. `POST /api/telegram/events` returns `200` for valid Telegram updates
2. Sending `/connect <code>` in bot DM links the account
3. A normal DM message gets an assistant response

If linking fails, generate a new code — codes are one-time and expire after 10 minutes.

For local development, Telegram must reach a public HTTPS URL (for example, via ngrok); `localhost` is not reachable from Telegram.
